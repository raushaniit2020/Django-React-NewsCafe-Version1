# Django-React-NewsCafe-Version1

Created two version of this WebApp, that has a subtle difference.One version uses news from newsapi.org sent by backend & other uses news from Database of backend.

Created this by using Django(as backend), ReactJs(as frontend), Firebase(for registration, signin, signout), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Axios(in one), Fetch(in other), SQLite3, Material-UI, Bootstraps

It has features like Filter by all Category & Country included in newsapi.org from navbar, General Search bar, SignUp, SignIn, SignOut, Like, Dislike(Used material-UI icon for all these)
# Dependencies need to be installed(Basic installation are not covered)
   # For ReactJs(FrontEnd)
      create-react-app, and also start django-project
      install node-js, react-router-dom, firebase(also register app in firebase), @mui/icons-material etc

# Note: We need to copy a piece of code from firebase to a separate file in our project. This step will be clear while registering app in firebase and following steps as mentioned in firebase registeration form.
