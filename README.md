# Django-React-NewsCafe-Version1


# Created two version of this WebApp, that has a subtle difference.One version uses news from newsapi.org sent by backend & other uses news from Database of backend.


# Created this by using Django(as backend), ReactJs(as frontend), Firebase(for registration, signin, signout), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Axios(in one), Fetch(in other), SQLite3, Material-UI, Bootstraps


# It has features like Filter by all Category & Country included in newsapi.org from navbar, General Search bar, SignUp, SignIn, SignOut, Like, Dislike(Used material-UI icon for all these)
